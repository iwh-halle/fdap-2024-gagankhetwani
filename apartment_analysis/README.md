### Description of the case study and instructions

### Objective:
This case study focuses on the apartment sharing market in Frankfurt, utilizing data collection, analysis, and interpretation to understand the determinants of apartment prices and the factors influencing the duration of WG (Wohngemeinschaft) listings on the WG-Gesucht platform. The ultimate deliverable is a README.md file summarizing the analysis and findings, with supporting evidence from literature and data analysis.

### Literature Review:
Before conducting the web scraping, a literature review was performed to explore the factors affecting the housing market and related prices. The findings from this review are detailed in a dedicated chapter, where relevant literature is briefly summarized, providing initial reference points for the subsequent analysis.

The results of the literature review are documented in the Read.me file within the "literature_review" folder.


### Scraper: 
The web scraping process is done in a file name scraper in the folder.



### Summary of the Code:

This Jupyter notebook performs a comprehensive data analysis workflow, including:

1. **Data Loading**: Reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Preparing features for machine learning models.
5. **Model Building**: Training and evaluating various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression.
6. **Text Analysis**: Generating a word cloud to visualize frequent terms in text data.

This notebook provides a complete end-to-end process from data cleaning to model evaluation and visualization, ensuring that the data is well-understood and properly prepared for predictive modeling.
