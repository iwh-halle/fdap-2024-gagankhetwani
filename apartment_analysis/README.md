## Summary of Findings

The document titled "Stimulating housing policy and housing tenure choice: Evidence from the G7 countries" provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing housing tenure choices and the effectiveness of government policies in promoting affordable housing. The study covers G7 countries from 1919 to 2020 and uses a novel index to measure governmental support for affordable housing construction.

### Key Findings

1. **Governmental Policies and Homeownership**:
   - Governmental policies positively affect homeownership rates and social housing rates. Policies such as provision of cheaper loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, and tax exemptions have been effective in increasing homeownership and social housing[1].
   - The study uses a leximetric approach to quantify these policies, creating composite indices to measure their impact.

2. **Socioeconomic Determinants**:
   - Age, income, household size, race, ethnicity, and immigration status are significant determinants of housing tenure choice. Middle-aged individuals with sufficient savings are more likely to own homes, while younger people tend to rent due to higher mobility and lower savings[1].

3. **Impact of Housing Policies**:
   - Stimulating housing policies, though costly, are crucial for increasing the supply of affordable housing. These policies include both owner-occupied and social rental housing measures[1].
   - The effectiveness of these policies varies across countries, with some nations like Germany focusing on subsidizing private landlords to provide low-cost dwellings to specific population groups[1].

4. **Homeownership and Social Housing Rates**:
   - Homeownership rates have generally increased since World War II but experienced setbacks during economic downturns like the Great Recession of 2008-2009[1].
   - Social housing sectors are significant in many European countries, often larger than private rental sectors, indicating strong governmental support for social housing[1].

## Hypotheses on Variables Influencing Apartment Prices in Frankfurt

Based on the findings from the document, the following hypotheses can be developed regarding variables that might influence apartment prices in Frankfurt:

1. **Governmental Housing Policies**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Increased governmental support for affordable housing (e.g., subsidies, tax exemptions, cheaper loans) will lead to a decrease in apartment prices in Frankfurt.
   - **Rationale**: Policies that stimulate housing construction and provide financial support to homebuyers can increase the supply of housing, thereby reducing prices.

2. **Socioeconomic Factors**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Higher average income levels and larger household sizes will lead to higher apartment prices in Frankfurt.
   - **Rationale**: Higher incomes increase purchasing power, while larger household sizes increase demand for larger living spaces, both of which can drive up prices.

3. **Age Structure**:
   - **Hypothesis**: A higher proportion of middle-aged residents will lead to higher apartment prices in Frankfurt.
   - **Rationale**: Middle-aged individuals are more likely to purchase homes, increasing demand and driving up prices.

4. **Urbanization and Population Growth**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Increased urbanization and population growth will lead to higher apartment prices in Frankfurt.
   - **Rationale**: Urbanization and population growth increase demand for housing in urban areas, leading to higher prices.

5. **Economic Conditions**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Economic downturns (e.g., recessions) will lead to a temporary decrease in apartment prices in Frankfurt.
   - **Rationale**: Economic downturns reduce purchasing power and demand for housing, leading to lower prices.

These hypotheses can be tested using econometric models and data on Frankfurt's housing market, socioeconomic indicators, and governmental policies.
